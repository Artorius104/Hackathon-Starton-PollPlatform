# Poll of Autumn

Platform to create your own polls on the Blockchain created by 3 Epitech Students


## Problem
- Lack of transparency on votes' results (expl : for elections) 
- Results not necessarily updated
- The creator can not choose how many people will participate
The platform helps decentralizing votes/poll results by putting them on the Blockchain with the history of every actions 

## Solution
Our project resolves this issues by: 
- Allowing everyone to have their own voice
- Generating a smart contract for the creator to choose how many people can vote
- The results are updated, appears on the blockchain (and we generate a new NFT with the current results)
