# Poll of Autumn

Platform to create your own polls on the Blockchain created by 3 Epitech Students


## Problem 🤔
- Lack of transparency on votes' results (expl : for elections) 
- Results not necessarily updated
- The creator can not choose how many people will participate
- Fight against abstentionnism
 
The platform helps decentralizing votes/poll results by putting them on the Blockchain with the history of every actions 

## Solution 💡
Our project resolves this issues by: 
- Allowing everyone to have their own voice
- Generating a smart contract for the creator to choose how many people can vote
- The results are updated, appears on the blockchain (and we generate a new NFT with the current results)
- At the end of the poll, the user receive an NFT for answering the form
Theses functionalities were possible thanks to TypeScript and React

## Installation 📥
- Clone the repository then go to pillar-of-autumn folder ``cd pillar-of-autumn``
- Then run ``npm install`` to install all dependencies.
- Run ``npm start`` to run the project.

All web pages are unfinished, and will remain static.
To switch between the different views :
- Go to src/App.tsx =, turn the current view into comment and uncomment the view you would like to see.
- Currently, only a sign in, sign up, poll creation and poll answer pages are available.

## Team and comments 👨‍🎓
_Project created by Poll Of Autumn_
During this hackathon we've learned 
- How the Blockchain and the Web 3.0 work and their importance
- How to deploy Smart contracts and tokens with [Starton](https://www.starton.io/)_
- How to code a MVP ((minimum viable product)) in 48h
We also used organisation tools such as Miro.

We did not succeed to implement relations with the Starton API due to bad time management.
As a result, smart contracts, NFT's and all interactions with the web page are not present.
